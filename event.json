      "body": "This PR is mostly about cleanups. I was originally trying to improve `TransactionManager::get_extents_if_live()` to be common without segment-specific assumptions -- segment reclaiming assumes that no one else can modify the reclaiming extent in parallel except splitting/retiring it. This is why the current implementation expects to read out none or multiple extents from one allocation info.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the transaction cannot reliably read out absent extents from backref allocation info, even though the info is correct at the read time. This is because (for example) we have to asynchronously query the lba tree before actually reading an absent logical extent out, and the original alloc-info can be out-dated as the procedure is not atomic.\r\n\r\nThe instinct solution is to load and add the extent to the transaction read-set first before doing asynchronous queries (also refer to https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/45519#discussion_r917219468). But it turns out that this requires some fundamental changes. Specifically, loading an extent from cache requires an `init_func` parameter. For a logical extent it requires a pin as the assumption is the lba tree was queried first. For an lba extent it requires meta information as it assumes that the parent nodes were queried beforehand.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure whether the described issue will be a problem for RBM with overwrite capabilities. For example when decide to load and evict a cold extent from RBM tier to a slower tier, would this leads to evicting an unrelated extent?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @myoungwon @xxhdx1985126 @athanatos \r\n\r\n\u003c!--\r\n  - Please give your pull request a title like\r\n\r\n      [component]: [short description]\r\n\r\n  - Please use this format for each git commit message:\r\n\r\n      [component]: [short description]\r\n\r\n      [A longer multiline description]\r\n\r\n      Fixes: [ticket URL on tracker.ceph.com, create one if necessary]\r\n      Signed-off-by: [Your Name] \u003c[your email]\u003e\r\n\r\n    For examples, use \"git log\".\r\n--\u003e\r\n\r\n## Contribution Guidelines\r\n- To sign and title your commits, please refer to [Submitting Patches to Ceph](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/main/SubmittingPatches.rst).\r\n\r\n- If you are submitting a fix for a stable branch (e.g. \"pacific\"), please refer to [Submitting Patches to Ceph - Backports](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/SubmittingPatches-backports.rst) for the proper workflow.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- Tracker (select at least one)\r\n  - [ ] References tracker ticket\r\n  - [ ] Very recent bug; references commit where it was introduced\r\n  - [ ] New feature (ticket optional)\r\n  - [ ] Doc update (no ticket needed)\r\n  - [ ] Code cleanup (no ticket needed)\r\n- Component impact\r\n  - [ ] Affects [Dashboard](https://tracker.ceph.com/projects/dashboard/issues/new), opened tracker ticket\r\n  - [ ] Affects [Orchestrator](https://tracker.ceph.com/projects/orchestrator/issues/new), opened tracker ticket\r\n  - [ ] No impact that needs to be tracked\r\n- Documentation (select at least one)\r\n  - [ ] Updates relevant documentation\r\n  - [ ] No doc update is appropriate\r\n- Tests (select at least one)\r\n  - [ ] Includes [unit test(s)](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/dev/developer_guide/tests-unit-tests/)\r\n  - [ ] Includes [integration test(s)](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/dev/developer_guide/testing_integration_tests/)\r\n  - [ ] Includes bug reproducer\r\n  - [ ] No tests\r\n\r\n\u003cdetails\u003e\r\n\u003csummary\u003eShow available Jenkins commands\u003c/summary\u003e\r\n\r\n- `jenkins retest this please`\r\n- `jenkins test classic perf`\r\n- `jenkins test crimson perf`\r\n- `jenkins test signed`\r\n- `jenkins test make check`\r\n- `jenkins test make check arm64`\r\n- `jenkins test submodules`\r\n- `jenkins test dashboard`\r\n- `jenkins test dashboard cephadm`\r\n- `jenkins test api`\r\n- `jenkins test docs`\r\n- `jenkins render docs`\r\n- `jenkins test ceph-volume all`\r\n- `jenkins test ceph-volume tox`\r\n- `jenkins test windows`\r\n\u003c/details\u003e\r\n",
